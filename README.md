### ProductivityTracker

## Description
This is a work-in-progress whenever time presents itself. Previously, I had been tracking any form of time spent on any skill on spreadsheets. While other novel productivity tracking apps already exist, I'm taking the opportunity to build the base logic in python, and eventually expand to three types of development I'm unfamiliar with - native MacOS, iOS and Android.
